#contributing  
--------------------  
Feel free to contribute. This software is open- source, MIT license. Fork and clone, or clone and push to your feature branch on this repo. I will be updating this project regularly as my job search entails. Things that I plan to add are more custom scss rules for styles, fixing the current implementation of "dark mode", etc. This is a good boilerplate for displaying your resume, and then, through the axios API call, having it update across the board. It is based off of a tutorial I found on medium, at https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-an-awesome-developer-portfolio-website-using-react-667abd7bab4d and the gitconnected API. https://gitconnected.com/portfolio-api . I hope to eventually hone this into the portfolio site f the gods. For now, it displays data correctly. Cheers!
